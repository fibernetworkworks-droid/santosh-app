"""v0.201.0 AWAAZ-2, the feeling engine (Phase C's core, pulled forward): the owner's 8-point ear test on
v0.199.0 proved the static delivery block teaches WORDS, not sound - pauses, breathing and soft-on-heavy
news FAILED, because a system-prompt line is too far from the moment. But gemini-3.8-live accepts mid-call
quiet notes (v0.150.1 voicecheck; a 1007 right after one flips the call to queued notes), so the note can
ride the open channel WHILE she is speaking, before he answers. This module turns her words into that one
note. High precision on purpose: a wrong note is worse than no note - a soft sad voice over a joke is
uncanny - so the lexicon is small and sure, phrases only, three states, and the caller debounces (once per
turn, only on change, never two notes close together).

v0.208.0 AWAAZ-3 (Phase C's remainder): the TurnMeter prosody joins as the promised SHARPENING rule, never
as the only signal. Her words still pick the state; her voice THIS turn, measured against HER OWN baseline
(voicestyle profile facts - phone mics lie, but her normal does not), can now VETO a glad note it
contradicts (sarcasm, tiredness - a celebration voice over flat words is exactly the uncanny note the
precision rule forbids), CONFIRM a low one, and her measured thinking-pauses add a 'jaldi mat kaato' rider
(the ear test's list-rush failure, grounded in her own pauses)."""
